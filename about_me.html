<h2> A Recent Trip: </h2>
<p> During break my friends and I booked an airbnb together in Plum Beach, Newbury. I brought my wii and we made lots of good food! </p>

<h2> Some pet names off the noggin:</h2>
<ul>
<li> a dog named mochi! </li>
<li> a kitten named tangerine! </li>
<li> a turtle named thomas! </li>
</ul>
<p>To cite my sources: my girlfriend made two of these.</p>

<h2> My Favorite Restuarant: </h2>
<p>This place has some of the most delicious ramen around! Easily some of the most flavorful broth in the city, with an affordable price to match. If you want to see more just look at their menu

  <p style="padding-left: 20px; max-width: 50%;">I love ramen. There are so many different kinds of broth, but I adore a pork or miso broth. Tonkotsue or miso ramen is easily the best, and if you too enjoy this wonderful food check out the link above!</p>
